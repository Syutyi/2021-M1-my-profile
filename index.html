					<p>Someone once said, "Big results require big ambitions." and it totally suits the person who I am 🌠. I am passionate about new technologies, photography and martial arts. Thanks to 10 years I have spent on practicing martial arts, I have acquired the taste of challenge and effort. I could say I am focused on results and target-driven, I look forward to discover new experiences and places since every journey or encounter is an opportunity to learn something new 📚. Do not hesitate to send me an email, I will be delighted to discuss with you about our respective ambitions.</p>
